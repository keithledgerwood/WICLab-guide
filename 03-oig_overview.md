Okta Identity Governance (OIG) is a unified IAM and governance solution that includes three products to help governance, risk and compliance teams simplify access fulfillment and entitlement tasks throughout the identity lifecycle:
-   Okta Lifecycle Management
-   Okta Workflows
-   Okta Access Governance

**Okta Lifecycle Management** provides pre-built integrations between HR and IT systems, to automatically keep employee information and status in sync with the IT applications they use. As employees join, move, or leave the company, IT can automatically assign, upgrade, or revoke applications and access, to increase productivity, protect the organization from data loss, and eliminate orphaned accounts that increase the attack surface area.

**Okta Workflows** provides the extensibility and customization necessary to solve the complex identity governance requirements of your particular organization. Easily automate identity processes at scale, without writing a single line of code. Enable anyone at your company to create innovative solutions with Okta using if-this-then-that logic, Okta’s pre-built connector library, and the ability to connect to any publicly available API.

**Okta Access Governance** plays a central role in the solution, simplifying access management tasks so administrators can make sure the right people have access to the right resources when they need them. Access Governance includes three key features:

- **Access Request** simplifies and automates the process of requesting access to applications and resources. It meets users where they are by offering self-service capabilities tightly integrated with collaboration tools, delivering a streamlined, frictionless approach that automatically routes user requests to one or more reviewers for approval and auto-provisions the access.

- **Access Certification** campaigns offer a simple process for creating audit campaigns to periodically review user access to critical resources and approve or revoke access automatically. Those processes are important for making sure employees do not accumulate access, and only users who need a resource have access to it.

- **Governance Reports** help organizations meet audit and compliance requirements. Share a high-level overview of past certification campaigns, including their duration and the resources included—or add more detail, including the users involved and remediation status. Administrators can also provide an audit of who has access to what resources, who approved the access and how they got the access. Access governance data is stored for 3 years.

With these combined capabilities, OIG helps organizations improve their security posture, mitigate modern risks, and improve efficiency. Unlike traditional IGA products, which can require complex and custom integrations that are difficult to deploy and expensive to maintain, Okta’s unified approach brings together identity, access, and governance to holistically improve an organization’s security posture. For example, customers today can integrate Okta with existing HR systems and directories and manage who gets access to what resources. If Okta detects unusual activity, such as a high-risk login through Okta ThreatInsights or a lifecycle status change, you can trigger a certification campaign and immediately suspend access to a resource.
