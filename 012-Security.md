## Install Okta Verify

### Overview

Okta Verify is a multifactor authentication (MFA) app developed by Okta. It lets users verify their identity when they sign in to Okta and makes it less likely that someone pretending to be the user can gain access to the account.

To use Okta Verify, you must install the app on your device and set it up. Then, when end users sign in to Okta, they can verify their identity by approving a push notification in the app, or by entering a one-time code provided by the app into Okta.
