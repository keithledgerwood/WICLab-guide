Overview
This guide provides instructions for integrating Okta with Microsoft Office 365 so that the following
use cases can be demonstrated:
● Single Sign-on (SSO) from Okta to Microsoft Office 365
● Lifecycle Management (LCM) for Microsoft Office 365
This guide also provides instructions for setting up a scheduled import and a scheduled workflow
which will exercise the Microsoft Graph API in your E5 sandbox to prevent it from expiring.
Before you can complete this guide you must have already signed up for a Microsoft E5 sandbox
and configured it with a custom DNS domain.  A custom DNS domain is required because it’s not
possible to set up federation against the default onmicrosoft.com domain.
Instructions for this can be found here: Get Microsoft E5 sandbox
This guide assumes that you have at least one test user (in addition to your admin user) defined in
your Okta org.
