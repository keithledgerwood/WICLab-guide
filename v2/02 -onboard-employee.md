# Onboard New Team Member

## Introduction

One of the most powerful features of Okta is the quick time to market that it provides. In this challenge, BambooHR will be integrated with Okta so it can act as the authoritative source of Identity Data.

Sourcing Identity Data from an HR system (such as BambooHR) has several advantages. New Employees typically get added to the HR system as part of their corporate onboarding process. Once integrated, Okta imports the selected attributes into Okta and provisions birthright access to applications.

The Okta feature that brings it all together is Universal Directory, which not only stores the employee identity data, but provides an extremely flexible way to map the attributes from one source to another.

This lab uses a pre-built and managed instance of BambooHR. The environment has users and groups defined in a pre-designed organizational structure. The integration has two connections. The first uses SSO integration to access the BambooHR tenant. The Second uses an API connection to import users from BambooHR into Oktaâ€™s Universal Directory.

### Configure Import

In this section you will configure inbound provisioning from BambooHR to Okta.  This will allow you to perform a one-time import of existing users into Okta Universal Directory.

In fact, you could perform this one-time import without doing any configuration, and manually match the account, but it makes sense to set up account matching for completeness.  Follow these steps:

1. In the **General** section, click **Edit** to define import settings.

## Conclusion

Congrats! In just a few minutes, you made your HR system the authoritative source of Identities. You configured attribute mapping and created a transformation such that the username and email address would be a certain way upon the import.

Using these powerful features from Okta will allow you the flexibility to onboard users from multiple sources and create a single record containing only the attributes you want, from the sources that you want.

This is critical not just to keep your data clean and business secure, but to onboard other Lines of Business and possibly other companies in an M&A scenario.
