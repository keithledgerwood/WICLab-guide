Imagine being entrusted with your organization’s Workforce Identity Management. Your mission, should you choose to accept it:

1. Cut Down on IAM Costs

3. Enhance Visibility into employee access patterns and act on them.

And... all the while ensuring an incredible user experience that amplifies productivity. Sounds intense, doesn’t it?

Here’s the Twist: With the unparalleled capabilities of Okta’s Workforce Identity Cloud, it's more than possible. And we're here to guide you every step of the way!

### Initial access to your Okta tenant

1. In the mailbox you used for registration, find and open the "Your New Okta account" email.
2. Copy the temporary password, and then click **Sign On**.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen to sign on to your Okta org.

> **Note:** This will require that you sign in with your temporary password, set up a new password and set up the Okta Verify app on your mobile device. After successful sign on, you will see the Okta End-User Dashboard.

### Manual Tasks
