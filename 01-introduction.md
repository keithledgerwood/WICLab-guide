Hey there... we have some exciting enhancements and automated tasks planned for this lab, however, there are still some "to be automated" steps that need to be manually by wonderful people like yourself.

 So, after you've signed into your demo org, but before you've added your first employee, please see you manual chore list: [WIC Acceleration Lab](<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/105BjtBmVze3ruoFBdtSuPdW9-bDR8qqV?usp=drive_link> "Manual Chores")

THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
