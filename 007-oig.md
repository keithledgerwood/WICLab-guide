# Identity Governance

Okta Identity Governance (OIG) is a unified IAM and governance solution that includes three products to help governance, risk and compliance teams simplify access fulfillment and entitlement tasks throughout the identity lifecycle:

- Okta Lifecycle Management
- Okta Workflows
- Okta Access Governance

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image2.png "image_tooltip")

Okta Lifecycle Management provides pre-built integrations between HR and IT systems, to automatically keep employee information and status in sync with the IT applications they use. As employees join, move, or leave the company, IT can automatically assign, upgrade, or revoke applications and access, to increase productivity, protect the organization from data loss, and eliminate orphaned accounts that increase the attack surface area.

Okta Workflows provides the extensibility and customization necessary to solve the complex identity governance requirements of your particular organization. Easily automate identity processes at scale, without writing a single line of code. Enable anyone at your company to create innovative solutions with Okta using if-this-then-that logic, Okta’s pre-built connector library, and the ability to connect to any publicly available API.

Okta Access Governance plays a central role in the solution, simplifying access management tasks so administrators can make sure the right people have access to the right resources when they need them. Access Governance includes three key features:

- Access Request simplifies and automates the process of requesting access to applications and resources. It meets users where they are by offering self-service capabilities tightly integrated with collaboration tools, delivering a streamlined, frictionless approach that automatically routes user requests to one or more reviewers for approval and auto-provisions the access.
- Access Certification campaigns offer a simple process for creating audit campaigns to periodically review user access to critical resources and approve or revoke access automatically. Those processes are important for making sure employees do not accumulate access, and only users who need a resource have access to it.
- Governance Reports help organizations meet audit and compliance requirements. Share a high-level overview of past certification campaigns, including their duration and the resources included—or add more detail, including the users involved and remediation status. Administrators can also provide an audit of who has access to what resources, who approved the access and how they got the access. Access governance data is stored for 3 years.

With these combined capabilities, OIG helps organizations improve their security posture, mitigate modern risks, and improve efficiency. Unlike traditional IGA products, which can require complex and custom integrations that are difficult to deploy and expensive to maintain, Okta’s unified approach brings together identity, access, and governance to holistically improve an organization’s security posture. For example, customers today can integrate Okta with existing HR systems and directories and manage who gets access to what resources. If Okta detects unusual activity, such as a high-risk login through Okta ThreatInsights or a lifecycle status change, you can trigger a certification campaign and immediately suspend access to a resource.

## Lab description

The first capability we will explore is Access Requests (Part 1). Once configured it can be used to grant access to be subsequently reviewed/revoked in Access Certifications (Part 2) and audited through our audit and reporting capabilities (Part3).

This section of the document will explore the unconfigured Access Requests, walk through standard configuration (Okta and Slack integration), then create and run a simple approval flow.

## Access Requests 

Prior to working through the sections looking at the three capabilities, you will need to perform the following actions:

1. Create distribution lists in google using Okta Workflows along with Okta OOTB Google Workspace Connector

1. Open Okta Workflows Console from Okta Admin dashboard
2. Go to the Flows tab from the top hand side
3. Create a folder named OKTA-WIC-WORKSHOP-IGA-LAB

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image35.png "image_tooltip")

4. Click on the three dots and Import the file oktaWicWorkshopIgaLab.folder

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image39.png "image_tooltip")

5. Open the Flow 1\_Create Okta Group, choose the Okta Connection on the Create Group Card and activate the flow

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image49.png "image_tooltip")

6. Activate the mail flow : 0\_Read DLs and run the flow to import the Distribution Lists in Okta as groups

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image51.png "image_tooltip")

7. Navigate to the Okta Admin Console, go to Groups under Directory and check that the groups prefixed by “DL\_” are created

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image31.png "image_tooltip")

8. Use Google Workspace Connector to push the groups as Distribution Lists to Google. Open Google Workspace integration under Applications -> Applications
9. Go to Push Groups tab and create a group push policy rule

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image53.png "image_tooltip")

10. Create a rule to push all the groups with a name starting by “DL\_”

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image14.png "image_tooltip")

11. Check the creation of Distribution List in Google by navigating to Google Admin console, go to Groups under Directory

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image43.png "image_tooltip")

2. Configure Okta Access Requests:

1. Allow all users in Okta to request access from the Okta Access Requests application. From the Okta Admin Console, go to Applications -> Applications and select the Okta Access Requests

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image22.png "image_tooltip")

2. Go to the Assignments tab and assign the group Everyone to the application, it will allow all users in Okta to access and submit requests

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image67.png "image_tooltip") 

3. Now we will explore the vanilla Access Requests module. From within the Admin console go to Identity Governance > Access Requests (it will open a new browser tab)
4. The default landing page is the Requests > Inbox view, where any requests awaiting action by this admin are displayed. It is empty.
5. Go to Teams menu item :  Teams are an Access Requests grouping mechanism. Workflows must be assigned to a Team, and Teams can be used to scope who can run a workflow or participate in it. There is a default team created called IT. For the sake of the exercise, we will create a team called Request Admin
6. Click the Add Team button
7. Select the team icon and color (optional), give it a Name and Description (optional)
8. Add team Members (type part of their name and select from the result list)

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image16.png "image_tooltip")

9. Go to the Settings menu item. There are currently four integrations available – Slack, Jira, servicenow and Okta. The Okta integration is partially configured, and the others unconfigured. We will configure Slack in the next section. 
10. Click on the Resources tab towards the top of the page.

Configuration items in Access Requests are lists of objects that can be used in flows. The default lists that are automatically synced from Okta are all Applications and all Groups. 

11. Click on the icon beside the Applications configuration item and click on sync Update now button

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image19.png "image_tooltip")

12. On the Application configuration item, click on Manage Access button

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image55.png "image_tooltip")

13. It opens a popup, select both options IT and Request Admins: these two teams can use all the applications when constructing access requests

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image33.png "image_tooltip")

14. Do the same for the Groups configuration item
15. Go to the Configuration lists tab and click on Create new list named List of Google DLs of type Resource list of Okta Groups, allowing the two teams IT and Request Admins to use the lists. Add the following items in the list

<table class="c24"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c17">DL_UK_LONDON</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c17">DL_FRANCE_PARIS</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_GERMANY_BERLIN</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_SPAIN_MADRID</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_NETHERLANDS_AMSTERDAM</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_ERP</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_ERP_SAP</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_ERP_JDE</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_CRM</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_CRM_SLAESFORCE</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="c8"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c7 c22">Note the </span><span class="c4 c22">Create new list</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;button. This feature can include static lists of items to include in an Access Request flow (e.g. include a drop-down list of standard items to select from). It also has the potential to pull groups of applications or similar from Okta in the future.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image34.png "image_tooltip")

16. Follow the same steps and create a second list named List of Risky Google DLs of type Resource list of Okta Groups, allowing the two teams IT and Request Admins to use the lists. Add the following items in the list.

<table class="c24"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_ERP</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_ERP_SAP</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_ERP_JDE</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_CRM</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_CRM_SLAESFORCE</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Create the Approval Workflow process

To show workflow creation we will create a simple Access Request workflow for one of the Distribution Lists we have created previously. It will go through the manager's approval as a first step. If the DL is risky, it will go through a second level approval to the DL owner. For this to work, you need to have users that have a manager set (managerId field in the user profile).

1. Create the approval workflow

1. In the Access Requests UI as an administrator, go to Access Requests 
2. Click one of the Create access request workflow buttons

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image17.png "image_tooltip")

3. On the Workflow Details dialog, pick a workflow icon (optional), give the workflow a Name : Request Distribution List, and enter a Description (optional)
4. You need to select a Team to own this workflow. Select the new team we added earlier
5. The Audience is who can see and run this workflow. You can say everyone in the organization, a Team, or one of the groups synced from Okta. For this example, select the group everyone
6. Click the Continue button

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image30.png "image_tooltip")

<table class="c8"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c7 c22">Note that you can’t select the </span><span class="c4 c22">Mark as done automatically </span><span class="c5">toggle. The workflow needs steps before this can be done.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The workflow is now ready for the steps to be added.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image8.png "image_tooltip")

<table class="c8"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Note that the workflow is in a Draft state and needs to be published to be used. Once a workflow is published, you normally must revert it to Draft to modify (which removes it from use).</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Workflows have four types of steps; Questions (prompt for input), Tasks (assign a todo), Approvals and Actions (which is how the Okta functions are implemented). We will add some Questions, two levels of Approval and an Action to add the user to the DL in Okta (which is an Okta Group). The UI has a dot-matrix area where you can work on the steps – I’ll refer to this as the workflow editor.

The first step in an access request flow is to get the requester to supply some information, such as a justification and the selected Distribution List. We will add three fields to help the reviewers decide if access should be granted: a justification, the DL. You can use whatever fields you like.

7. Click on the Add to workflow button beside Question
8. Ignore the box in the middle of the page and go to the right of the screen under the Question heading
9. Enter the title of the field Which Distribution List would you like to request? in the Text box (and notice that the box in the middle field is updated)
10. Leave it as a required field
11. Set  the Type as Dropdown
12. Set Data source as Configuration Item and select List of Google DLs previously created
13. Leave it Assigned to the Requester

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image7.png "image_tooltip")

<table class="c8"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">You have the option of asking other people (like the requester’s manager) to supply information in a question, which may be useful for more complex flows requiring multiple inputs.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

14. Click the Question button at the bottom of the workflow editor
15. Enter the title of the field (e.g. Justification) in the Text box
16. Leave it as a required field
17. Leave the Type as Text
18. Leave it Assigned to the Requester

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image23.png "image_tooltip")

Next, we will add two levels of approval with some conditional logic.

19. Click the Approval button at the bottom of the workflow editor
20. In the right pane give the task a name (like “Manager Approval”) and required
21. Leave the Type as Approval Task
22. From the Assigned to pulldown, select the Requester’s manager

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image46.png "image_tooltip")

<table class="c8"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Three things of note:</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">1. Even though the step is called an Approval, it is just another type of “task”</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">2. There is a lot of flexibility in who you can assign the approval step to. If it’s the manager,</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">Access Requests is using the user&lt;-&gt;manager relationship from Okta. But it could also be a member of a Team, a specific user, an Okta group, or the requester themselves. It can also be dynamically assigned by the process owner at runtime</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5">3. You can set a due date (in minutes/hours) on the review</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

This approval step will run once the requestor answers all the questions. With the second level of approval, we will apply some logic.

23. Click the Approval button at the bottom of the workflow editor
24. In the right pane give the task a name (like “DL Owner Approval”)
25. Make sure the Make it a required Task in unchecked
26. Leave the Type as Approval Task
27. From the Assigned to pulldown, select the Okta Group Owner(s) and in the Select an Okta group, choose Which DL would you like to request?

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image4.png "image_tooltip")

28. It will look like the following

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image11.png "image_tooltip")

<table class="c8"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c7 c22">Note the icons on the task cards. The one for </span><span class="c4 c22">Manager Approval</span><span class="c7 c22">&nbsp;is a hierarchy, indicating the requester's manager. The one for </span><span class="c4 c22">DL Owner Approval</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;is the icon we chose when creating the Team. You can hover the mouse over the icon to see the assignment.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Now we can apply logic to only run this approval if the manager has approved the request.

29. Click the Edit logic button at the bottom
30. Under the Logic tab, select Only show this task if
31. On the second field, select the Manager Approval task (or whatever you called the first approval step above)
32. On the third field, select is approved
33. Click Add a condition
34. On the Field or Task item, select Which DL would you like to request?
35. Select condition as in configuration list
36. choose the List of Risky Google DLs configuration list

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image10.png "image_tooltip")

The final step to add is the action to add the requester to the DL (Okta Group).

37. Click the Action button at the bottom of the workflow editor
38. Select the Add user to group option

<table class="c8"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c7 c22">There are many Okta actions that can be run in a workflow. The two that will be most used are </span><span class="c4 c22">Assign individual app to user</span><span class="c7 c22">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c22">Add user to a group</span><span class="c5">. You could explore the other actions available, some of which will retrieve data from Okta and display it in the details of the flow or even run a custom Okta Workflow.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

39.  In the right pane give the task a name Add User to non risky DL 
40. Make sure that Make it a required task is unchecked
41. Set the Type as \[Okta\] Add user to group
42. Select (enable) the Run automatically option (this will change the Assigned to value
43. to “Okta”)
44. In the expanded dialog, set the Email address as Requester email, the Select the
45. group field as Which DL would you like to request?

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image13.png "image_tooltip")

We also need to add logic

46.  Click the Edit logic button at the bottom
47. Under the Logic tab, select Only show this task if
48. On the second field, select the Manager’s Approval task (or whatever you called the first approval step above)
49. On the third field, select is approved
50. Click the Add a condition
51. On the Field or Task item, select Which DL would you like to request?
52. Select condition as not in configuration list
53. choose the List of Risky Google DLs configuration list

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image27.png "image_tooltip")

54. Click the Action button at the bottom of the workflow editor
55. Select the Add user to group option
56.  In the right pane give the task a name Add User to risky DL
57. Make sure that Make it a required task is unchecked
58. Set the Type as \[Okta\] Add user to group
59. Select (enable) the Run automatically option (this will change the Assigned to value
60. to “Okta”)
61. In the expanded dialog, set the Email address as Requester email, the Select the
62. group field as Which DL would you like to request?

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image48.png "image_tooltip")

We also need to add logic

63.  Click the Edit logic button at the bottom
64. Under the Logic tab, select Only show this task if
65. On the second field, select the Manager’s Approval task (or whatever you called the first approval step above)
66. On the third field, select is approved
67. Click the Add a condition
68. On the Field or Task item, select the DL Owner Approval task (or whatever you called the second approval step above)
69. Select condition as in configuration list
70. On the third field, select is approved
71. Click the Add a condition
72. On the Field or Task item, select Which DL would you like to request?
73. Select condition as in configuration list
74. choose the List of Risky Google DLs configuration list

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image61.png "image_tooltip")

That is the last step to add to the workflow. We have one more thing to do before publishing.

75. Click on the pencil icon beside the workflow name
76. Enable the Mark as done automatically? option at the bottom
77.  Click the Continue button

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image42.png "image_tooltip")

To publish the flow:

78. Click the Publish button on the top of the screen
79. Go to Access Requests > All
80. Your new workflow should be showing

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image68.png "image_tooltip")

### Use an Access Request Workflow from the Access Request UI

With the workflow created, the last step is to test it’s working. For this section you will need a user in the group you assigned to the workflow who has a manager defined in Okta an active Google Workspace account assigned.

#### Requester Raised Access Request

Access Request via Access Request UI:

1. As this user log into your Okta Dashboard
2. Click on the Okta Access Requests tile to open the Access Request UI

You should see the new Access Request workflow showing under the App Catalog heading

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image18.png "image_tooltip")

3.  Click the Request access button

You should see the two questions you added to the flow in the dialog.

4. Choose one of the risky DLs from the List and set a Justification

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image59.png "image_tooltip")

5. Click Submit new request

The view will change to show the details of the workflow, including the right panel showing the summary information about the request, the questions and the tasks.

6. Click on the Tasks item to see the next step in the flow.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image25.png "image_tooltip")

It is assigned to the requester's manager for review, as expected.

Next, we will review the access as the manager.

#### Manager Reviews Access Request

We need to act as the manager. If you want to keep your requester session active, you may want to use a different browser, a new browser tab in incognito mode, or a different browser profile.

1. Log into the Okta Dashboard as your manager
2. Click on the Okta Access Requests tile
3. The default view is the App Catalog. Click on the Requests menu item to see the new request in the Inbox.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image65.png "image_tooltip")

4. Click on the item to open it

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image12.png "image_tooltip")

The view is the same as the requester’s view. Note that the Tasks tab has a (1) beside it indicating there is some action required of the manager.

5. Click the Tasks tab to see the option to Approve or Deny the request, Click Approve

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image9.png "image_tooltip")

Obviously, the manager could Deny the request and the flow would stop here.

After a brief pause the flow will update the view.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image47.png "image_tooltip")

It shows in the main panel that the task (Manager Approval) has been Approved. It also shows in the right pane the next step in the flow, which is DL Owner Approval and it has been automatically assigned to the owner of DL (Alex Mayer in our example)

#### Perform DL Owner Approval Step

1. Log into the Okta Dashboard as your manager
2. Log into the Okta Dashboard as the DL Owner
3. You can retrieve the DL Owner from Okta Admin Dashboard

1. Login to the Okta Admin Dashboard as a Super Admin
2. Under Directory > Groups
3. Search for you DL you have request previously

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image6.png "image_tooltip")

4. Open the group and go to the Owners tab

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image44.png "image_tooltip")

5. Click on the owner Display Name (Alex Meyer in our example)
6. Go to the Profile tab and copy the username

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image24.png "image_tooltip")

7. copy the username and login to Okta Dashboard using the password W1cLa61!

4. Click on the Okta Access Requests tile
5. The default view is the App Catalog. Click on the Requests menu item to see the new request in the Inbox.
6. Click on the item to open it

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image64.png "image_tooltip")

7. Click the Tasks tab to see the option to Approve or Deny the request, Click Approve

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image50.png "image_tooltip")

After a brief pause the flow will update the view.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image40.png "image_tooltip")

This last step will add the user to the requested DL (as a group) in Okta. Before we check in Okta, let’s confirm what the requester sees.

#### Requester Confirmation

If not already there, go back into the Access Requests UI as the requester

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image66.png "image_tooltip")

The view is the same as what the last approver saw, showing the entire trail.

#### Check the access was assigned in Okta

The last thing to check is that the access was actually assigned in Okta:

1. Login to the Okta Admin Dashboard as a Super Admin
2. Under Directory > Groups
3. Search for you DL you have request previously

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image6.png "image_tooltip")

4. Open the group and go to the People tab
5. You should see the request as a member of the group

## Access Certification

The next capability we will explore is Access Certification. Access Certification (aka attestation, recertification etc.) is the mechanism to validate that a user still needs the access they have. It is a common control in compliance regulations. Certification campaigns may be run periodically, or there may be continuous certification when user roles change. Okta Identity Governance currently supports user-group memberships and user-application assignments. Participants in a campaign (such as the users manager) will approve (access retained) or revoke access (access should be removed).

This section of the document will explore the Access Certification mechanism in Okta Identity Governance by creating a campaign, launching it, and having a manager review access.

### Creating an Access Certification Campaign

Access certification is built into the Okta platform. There is an administrative interface to create and manage campaigns, and an end-user interface for participating in campaigns.

We will create a campaign for resources in your environment. The example below will review the Distribution List (Okta Group) assignment, where the Distribution List is the one that was used in the Access Request section earlier. You can use any Distribution List in your environment but recall that the users should have valid managers and DL owners.

#### Create a new campaign

To create a new campaign:

1. Login into Okta as an administrator and go to the Admin console
2. Find the new Identity Governance menu item and expand it
3. Click on Access Certifications

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image15.png "image_tooltip")

4. Click Create Campaign to start the wizard

The wizard will walk through five pages of settings to configure the campaign, the first being the General page.

5. On the General page of the wizard, give the campaign a name, a description (optional) and specify a start date(put the date a few days in the future) and make it a recurring review

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image20.png "image_tooltip")

The campaign creation progress is shown on the left and the right pane will build up a summary of the campaign as you progress through the wizard.

6. Click Next Button

The Resources page is where you decide what you are certifying – group membership or application assignment. You can only select one type or another, but you can select multiple of each.

7. Select Type of Groups
8. Select the risky DLs of your environment, you can see them in the table below

<table class="c24"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_ERP</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_ERP_SAP</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_ERP_JDE</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_CRM</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">DL_PROJECT_CRM_SLAESFORCE</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

10. The Resources section should look like the screenshot below

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image45.png "image_tooltip")

11. Click Next

On the Users page, you specify the scope of the users in the campaign. Are all users assigned to the group to be reviewed, or only some? Do you need to exclude specific users for some reason?

12. Leave the All users assigned to the resource option selected

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image21.png "image_tooltip")

13. Click Next

The reviewers are the Okta users who will review the access. There could be a single (static) reviewer specified as an Okta user. Or you can specify a dynamic reviewer, where the reviewer is based on some data in the Universal Directory (we will do this).

14. Select the First Level reviewer as the Manager
15. Set the fallback reviewer as you own admin account
16. Click on Add level to add a second reviewer level
17. Select the second reviewer as the Group Owner
18. Set the fallback reviewer as you own admin account
19. select the option Only approved decisions under the Additional Settings

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image29.png "image_tooltip")

20. Click Next

The remediation settings are the most important page – it’s the reason for the campaign. Every item (i.e. group membership or application assignment) has three options: approve, revoke and reassign.

If access is approved, the access is retained, and the decision is logged for audit purposes. If access is revoked, that’s indicating that the access should be removed. It can be flagged to be removed (i.e. don’t take any action) or removed. There may be implications on this depending on how the access was granted. Finally, a reviewer can reassign the review to someone else.

You also need to decide what is to occur if there are unreviewed items at the end of the campaign – should they be removed or left as is?

21. For the Reviewer revoke access option, select the Remove user from resource option
22. For the Reviewer does not respond option, select the Remove user from resource option

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image28.png "image_tooltip")

This is the last step in creating the campaign. You can go back and change things prior to scheduling.

23. Click the Schedule Campaign button to schedule it

The campaign will now appear under the Scheduled tab.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image5.png "image_tooltip")

24. Click on the Campaign name to open it.

You will see a summary of the campaign.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image26.png "image_tooltip")

<table class="c8"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">This campaign will start on schedule. Analyzing campaign contents (users, review items, reviewers etc.) may be computationally expensive, so the default behavior is to launch it overnight. However, you can manually launch it, which we will do next.the flow or even run a custom Okta Workflow.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Launching an Access Certification Campaign

To launch the campaign immediately:

1. Click the Actions button from the campaign view
2. Select the Launch option
3. On the Launch campaign confirmation screen, click the Launch button

You will return to the Access certification campaigns page.

4. Go to the Active tab
5. If you don’t see your campaign, refresh the page

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image37.png "image_tooltip")

6. Click on the campaign name to see the campaign details

The page provides an overview of the campaign (the same information that was presented pre-launch), the progress of the campaign, and the items to be reviewed. Depending on the users (and their manager settings) assigned to the selected groups, you should see some managers with one or more users. You may also have users that don’t have managers assigned, so they have the fallback reviewer as the reviewer.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image62.png "image_tooltip")

<table class="c8"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">An administrator can use this page to manage the execution of a campaign. They can see the progress and any items still outstanding. They can reassign one or more items. They can also prematurely end the campaign (Actions &gt; End).</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Participating in an Access Certification Campaign

##### Manager Review

Now that the campaign is running, we can switch to the role of reviewer to review some access. Select one of the reviewers (the manager as a first level) in your list above to perform the review.

1. Log into the Okta dashboard as that reviewer user
2. Look for the Okta Access Certification Reviews tile and click it

This tile (Okta application) is tied to a group where membership is dynamically managed within Okta. If an Okta user is flagged as a reviewer in any active campaign, they will be in the group and see the application on the dashboard.

You are presented with a list of campaigns the user is a reviewer for. You see a summary of information about each active campaign.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image41.png "image_tooltip")

3. Click on the name of the campaign to open it

You will see all users for this group reporting to this manager.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image1.png "image_tooltip")

For each item you have three options as a reviewer: Approve (leave the access as is), Revoke (remove access or flag for it to be removed) or Reassign (to another Okta user). Depending on screen resolution you will just see the icons or icons and words.

4. Click on the name of one of the users to see information about the user and access

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image3.png "image_tooltip")

This information is provided to help the reviewer in making their decision and currently includes user details and resource details, but there are plans to include fine-grained access information (if available) and review history.

5. Select one user and click the Approve (tick) button
6. When prompted, enter a Justification and click the Submit button

After each action, you will see a message displayed and the item will disappear from the view (they can be found under the Closed tab). When all are actioned, you will get confirmation that you are done with the reviews.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image56.png "image_tooltip")

##### DL Owner Review

Now that the reviewer has completed the first step review, we will go back to our campaign as the administrator and refresh our Certification Campaign page and see its progress. You will notice that the next level of review goes to the DL Owner (Alex Meyer in our case)

1. If not still there, log into Okta and then the Admin console as the administrator you used earlier.
2. Go to Identity Governance > Access Certifications and select the campaign

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image60.png "image_tooltip")

1. Log into the Okta dashboard as that reviewer user (DL Owner : alex Meyer in our case)
2. Look for the Okta Access Certification Reviews tile and click it
3. Click on the name of the campaign to open it

You will see all users for this group owned by Alex Meyer.

4. Select one user and click the Revoke (X) button
5. When prompted, enter a Justification and click the Submit button

Now that the reviewer has completed their review, we will close out the campaign as the administrator.

#### Managing an Access Certification Campaign

As mentioned earlier, we can manage running campaigns as the administrator.

1. If not still there, log into Okta and then the Admin console as the administrator you used earlier.
2. Go to Identity Governance > Access Certifications and select the campaign

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image38.png "image_tooltip")

You can see the progress of the campaign after the reviewer has completed their review.

3.  Have a look at the campaign item

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image63.png "image_tooltip")

4. On the campaign view page, select Actions > End to end the campaign
5. Click End Campaign on the confirmation screen

We can check the revocation actions:

6. Go to the group and confirm that users (where the remediation was Successful) were removed

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image52.png "image_tooltip")

7. Check the DL is revoke in Google Workspace

1. Navigate to the Google Admin Console: [https://admin.google.com/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://admin.google.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1691582006641782&usg=AOvVaw0NARHSLlzC6lF20rUrjer_)
2. Go to Directory > User
3. Open your test user
4. and check that the user is removed from the Group or the DL

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image36.png "image_tooltip")

8. At the top of the group page, click the View Logs link
9. Look for your Distribution List entry for your revoked user

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image57.png "image_tooltip")

10. You will see two entries one for the revocation of the access in Okta side and the other for the revocation in Google Workspace via our native connector.

This shows the remediation has worked as expected.

## Audit and Reporting

The final capability we will explore is Reporting. The reporting engine in Okta has been rewritten to support the new governance reporting needs. New IGA reports are being added continuously.

The documentation to support this can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/identity-governance/iga-reports.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1691582006645233&usg=AOvVaw1XHU6DjyLD-qA4f-28Bqre)

This section of the document will explore some of the IGA reports.

### Accessing Reports

Reporting is in the Okta Admin console:

1. Log into the Okta dashboard as an administrator and go to Admin 
2. Go to Reports > Reports

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcoBlaesing/LabGuide/main/images/007/image54.png "image_tooltip")

Whilst there are existing reports that may be relevant to IGA, there are two new sets of reports: Entitlements and Access, and Access Certification Campaigns reports. We will explore these below.

<table class="c8"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c5">With the new reports there are two ways a report may be delivered – it may be generated and presented in real-time as has been the case to now, or it may be generated in the background with the requester getting an email with a link to review the report. This is set for individual reports – you cannot specify which delivery mechanism.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Entitlement and Access Reports

We will have a look at some of these reports.

1. From the Reports page select the User Memberships report
