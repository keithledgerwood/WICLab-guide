## Workflow Connections

Now, let's configure the following Okta connectors in your Okta Tenant with Workflow enabled.

### Create an Okta Connection

1. In the Okta Admin Console select **Workflow** > **Workflows console**.

>**Note:** Your browser window now has an open tab open for the **Okta Admin Console** and another tab for the **Workflows Console**. Throughout this lab, you will be navigating between the two consoles, so pay close attention.

2. In the Workflows console, select **Connections**, and then click **New Connection**.
3. Enter **okta** in the search bar, and then click **Okta**.
4. Optional. Modify the default **Connection Nickname**.
5. Set **Domain** to the full domain of your Okta tenant.
 Be sure to include the **.okta.com** portion of the domain.

Keep this page open. You'll need to switch to your Okta Admin Console to get the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values needed for this Okta Connection and then return to the Workflows console to paste in the values.

#### Copy and paste the Client ID and Client Secret

1. In the Okta Admin Console, select **Applications** > **Applications**.
2. Select the **Okta Workflows OAuth** app, and then select the **Sign On** tab.
3. Copy the **Client ID**
4. Return to the **Workflows console** >  **New Connection** dialog, and then paste the **Client ID**.
5. Repeat the copy and paste steps for the **Client secret**.
6. Click **Create** to complete the Okta Connection.

### Create an API Connection

1. In the Workflows console, select **Connections**, and then click **New Connection**.
2. Enter **api** in the search bar, and then click **API Connector**.
3. Optional. Modify the default **Connection Nickname**.
4. For **Auth Type** select **Custom**.
5. Set **Header Name** to **Authorization**.

Keep this page open. Before you can set the **Header Value** for this API Connection,  you'll need to switch to your Okta Admin Console to obtain an API token. You will then return to the Workflows console to finish this configuration.

#### Create, copy and paste an API Token

For the workflows in the Okta Workflow Pack to work, you will first need to create a token to connect Okta APIs for that :

1. In the Okta Admin Console, select **Security** > **API**, and then select the **Tokens** tab
<!--

-->

2. Set the Token name to **WIC Lab Token**
3. Click **Create token**.
4. Copy the **Token Value**.
5. Return to the **Workflows console** >  **New Connection** dialog.
6. Set **Header Value** to **SSWS**, followed by a space, and then paste the **Token Value**.
Click **Create** to complete the API Connection.

-->
You now have the Flow correctly configured and running.

### Change the new employee's title

In order to trigger this Flow, an action we're listening to should occur. In this case, an existing user will have their title updated.

1. In the BambooHR dashboard search for and select your new employee.
2. On the **Job** tab, for **Job Information** click  **Add Entry**.
3. In the **Add Job Information** dialog, select a different title, and then click **Save**.

### Import the Title Change into Okta

1. In the Okta Admin Console, select **Applications** > **Applications**.
2. Select the  **BambooHR** app, and then select the **Import** tab.
<!--
![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithledgerwood/WICLab-guide/main/images/007/img21.png "image_tooltip")
-->
3. Click **Import Now**.
4. When the scan completes, confirm that one user was updated.
<!--
![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithledgerwood/WICLab-guide/main/images/007/img22.png "image_tooltip")
-->

This event will trigger the imported **Title Changed** flow, which creates and launches a certification campaign.

## Access Certification

Access certification is built into the Okta platform. There is an administrative interface to create and manage campaigns and an end-user interface for participating in campaigns.
Campaigns can be created via API and the UI of the admin platform.

### Verifying the Access Certification Campaign

To verify that a certification campaign was created by the flowpack, you will need to perform the following actions:
<!-->
#### Validate the created campaign

Before proceeding with the certification campaign, make sure that the user has at least one application assigned and the user is able to access that application.
-->
1. In the Okta Admin Console select **Identity Governance** > **Access Certifications**.
2. Verify that there is **Campaign** whose name starts with **Title Change:**.
3. Click on the **Title Change:**campaign to see an overview of the campaign.

The page provides an overview of the campaign, the progress of the campaign, and the items to be reviewed.An administrator can use this page to manage the execution of a campaign. They can see the progress and any items still outstanding. They can reassign one or more items. They can also prematurely end the campaign.

>**Note:** Please notify a lab assistant if there is no campaign listed.

### Participating in an Access Certification Campaign

### Review the Access Certification Campaign

1. In the Okta Admin Console, click on the *waffle icon* in the top right corner, and select  **My end user dashboard**,
 by clicking on the **Drop down menu** in the top right corner and click on **My End User Dashboard**
2. In the End User Dashboard, launch the **Okta Access Certification Reviews** app.
3. Click on the **Title Change** to see an overview of the campaign.

> **Note:** This app is tied to a group where membership is dynamically managed within Okta. If an Okta user is flagged as a reviewer in any active campaign, they will be in the group and see the application on the dashboard.

You are presented with a list of campaigns for which the user is a reviewer. You see a summary of information about each active campaign.

3. On the following page, you can see all of the open and closed review campaigns. Click on the **Campaign Name**

4. You will see all applications assigned to this user.
<!--
![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithledgerwood/WICLab-guide/main/images/007/img28.png "image_tooltip")
-->
> For each item, you have three options as a reviewer: Approve (leave the access as is), Revoke (remove access or flag for it to be removed), or Reassign (to another Okta user). You will see the icons or icons and words depending on the screen resolution.

5. Click on the name of one of the applications to see information about the user and resource
<!-->
![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithledgerwood/WICLab-guide/main/images/007/img29.png "image_tooltip")
-->
This information is provided to help the reviewer in making their decision. Currently, it includes user details and resource details, but there are plans to include fine-grained access information (if available) and review history.

6. Click **Approve**.
<!-->
