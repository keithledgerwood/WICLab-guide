## Requests, Approvals, and Access Certifications

In this lab, you will navigate the pathways of application access requests, demonstrating the seamless experience for employees itching to get their hands on the tools they need.

3. In the **New Connection** dialog search bar, enter **okta** and then click **Okta**.
4. Optional. Modify the default **Connection Nickname**.
5. Set **Domain** to the Okta tenant value found in the lab **Launch Panel**.

    |||
     |:-----|:-----|
     |![Okta Tenant](images/011/launch_okta_tenant_240.png "Okta Tenant")| |

Keep this page open. You'll need to switch to your Okta Admin Console to get the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values needed for this Okta Connection and then return to the Workflows console to paste in the values.

#### Copy and paste the Client ID and Client Secret

1. In the Okta Admin Console, select **Applications** > **Applications**.
2. Select the **Okta Workflows OAuth** app, and then select the **Sign On** tab.

### In BambooHR, change the New Employee's title

Promote your employee from Director to Sr. Director.

1. In the BambooHR dashboard search for and select your new employee.
2. On the **Job** tab, for **Job Information** click  **Add Entry**.
3. In the **Add Job Information** dialog, set the **Job Title** to **Sr. Director of Marketing**, and then click **Save**.

### Import the Title Change into Okta

1. In the Okta Admin Console, select **Applications** > **Applications**.
2. Select the  **BambooHR** app, and then select the **Import** tab.
3. Click **Import Now**.
4. When the scan completes, confirm that one user was updated.

This event will trigger the imported **Title Changed** flow, which creates and launches a certification campaign.

## Access Certification

Access certification is built into the Okta platform. There is an administrative interface to create and manage campaigns and an end-user interface for participating in campaigns. Campaigns can be created via API and the UI of the admin platform.

### Verify the Access Certification Campaign was created

To verify that a certification campaign was created by the flowpack, you will need to perform the following actions as the Okta admin:

1. In the Okta Admin Console select **Identity Governance** > **Access Certifications**.
1. Verify that there is **Campaign** whose name starts with **Title Change:**.
1. Click on the **Title Change:** campaign to see an overview of the campaign.

The page provides an overview of the campaign, the progress of the campaign, and the items to be reviewed. An administrator can use this page to manage the execution of a campaign. They can see the progress and any items still outstanding. They can reassign one or more items. They can also prematurely end the campaign.

>**Note:** Please notify a lab assistant if there is no campaign listed.

### Participating in an Access Certification Campaign

For the purposes of this lab, we decided to assign the Okta tenant administrator ( You ) to be the reviewer of this particular campaign. Reviews are performed with the **Okta Access Certification** app on your End User Dashboard.

1. In the Okta Admin Console, click the *waffle* icon in the top right corner, and then select **My end user dashboard**.
1. In the Okta admin's **End User Dashboard**, launch the **Okta Access Certification Reviews** app.
2. Click on the **Title Change** access certification campaign to see an overview of the campaign.
1. You will see all applications assigned to this user.

    > For each item, you have three options as a reviewer: Approve (leave the access as is), Revoke (remove access or flag for it to be removed), or Reassign (to another Okta user). You will see the icons or icons and words depending on the screen resolution.

1. Click on the name of one of the applications to see information about the user and resource.
This information is provided to help the reviewer in making their decision. Currently, it includes user details and resource details, but there are plans to include fine-grained access information (if available) and review history.
1. Click **Approve**.
1. When prompted, enter a **Justification**,  and then click the **Submit**.
1. Review the rest of the applications until you get the message **You have completed all your reviews**.

### End the Campaign

The campaign can be completed manually once the review is done or automatically after the **Set duration** passes.

1. In the Okta Admin Console select **Identity Governance** > **Access Certifications**.
2. Click the **Title Change** campaign and verify that the **Progress** is **100%**.
3. To end the campaign, click **Actions**, and then select **End**.
4. Click **End Campaign**.

## Conclusion

In this lab, we've charted the exciting terrains of application access with a dash of approval spice! While employees are keen to dive into their toolkits, we've ensured that some access is granted with a nod of approval. And for our administrative maestros? Setting up those approvals was as easy as pie, and periodic access reviews? Piece of cake!
