## Access Certification

Access certification is built into the Okta platform. There is an administrative interface to create and manage campaigns and an end-user interface for participating in campaigns. Campaigns can be created via API and the UI of the admin platform.

## Participate in an Access Certification Campaign

![contexttag](images/context-lab.png) ![contexttag](images/persona-okta-admin.png)

For the purposes of this lab, we decided to assign the Okta tenant administrator ( You ) to be the reviewer of this particular campaign. Reviews are performed with the **Okta Access Certification** app on your End User Dashboard.

1. In the Okta Admin Console, click the *waffle* icon in the top right corner, and then select **My end user dashboard**.
1. In the Okta admin's **End User Dashboard**, launch the **Okta Access Certification Reviews** app.
1. Click on the **Title Changed : Re-Certify** access certification campaign to see an overview of the campaign.
1. You will see all applications assigned to this user.

    > For each item, you have three options as a reviewer: Approve (leave the access as is), Revoke (remove access or flag for it to be removed), or Reassign (to another Okta user). You will see the icons or icons and words depending on the screen resolution.

1. Click on the name of one of the applications to see information about the user and resource.
This information is provided to help the reviewer in making their decision. Currently, it includes user details and resource details, but there are plans to include fine-grained access information (if available) and review history.
1. Click **Approve**.
1. When prompted, enter a **Justification**,  and then click the **Submit**.
1. Review the rest of the applications until you get the message **You have completed all your reviews**.

## Conclusion

In this lab, we've charted the exciting terrains of application access with a dash of approval spice! While employees are keen to dive into their toolkits, we've ensured that some access is granted with a nod of approval. And for our administrative maestros? Setting up those approvals was as easy as pie, and periodic access reviews? Piece of cake!
