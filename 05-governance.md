## Workflow Connections

Now, let's configure the following Okta connectors in your Okta Tenant with Workflow enabled.

### Create an Okta Connection

1. In the Okta Admin Console select **Workflow** > **Workflows console**.

2. In the Workflows console, select **Connections**, and then click **New Connection**.
3. In the **New Connection** dialog search bar, enter **okta** and then click **Okta**.
4. Optional. Modify the default **Connection Nickname**.
5. Set **Domain** to the full domain of your Okta tenant.
 Be sure to include the **.okta.com** portion of the domain.

Keep this page open. You'll need to switch to your Okta Admin Console to get the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values needed for this Okta Connection and then return to the Workflows console to paste in the values.

#### Copy and paste the Client ID and Client Secret

### Modify the imported Flow

There are a few modifications needed within the workflow. You will need to assign the Okta and API connections to the flow. You'll also need to specify your Okta tenant domain and your Okta admin account.

>**Tip:** To view a graphic of the complete TitleChanged flow, you can click **Flow Chart**when in edit mode.
 ![flow chart](images/011/titlechanged_flowchart_access_240.png).
 Here's a sneak peak look at the cards you will be changing: 1, 3, 8 and 23.

### In BambooHR, change the New Employee's title

In order to trigger this Flow, an action we're listening to should occur. In this case, an existing user will have their title updated.

1. In the BambooHR dashboard search for and select your new employee.
2. On the **Job** tab, for **Job Information** click  **Add Entry**.
3. In the **Add Job Information** dialog, select a different title, and then click **Save**.

### Import the Title Change into Okta

2. Select the  **BambooHR** app, and then select the **Import** tab.
3. Click **Import Now**.
4. When the scan completes, confirm that one user was updated.

This event will trigger the imported **Title Changed** flow, which creates and launches a certification campaign.

## Access Certification

Access certification is built into the Okta platform. There is an administrative interface to create and manage campaigns and an end-user interface for participating in campaigns.
Campaigns can be created via API and the UI of the admin platform.

### Verify the Access Certification Campaign was created

To verify that a certification campaign was created by the flowpack, you will need to perform the following actions as the Okta admin:

1. In the Okta Admin Console select **Identity Governance** > **Access Certifications**.
2. Verify that there is **Campaign** whose name starts with **Title Change:**.
3. Click on the **Title Change:**campaign to see an overview of the campaign.

The page provides an overview of the campaign, the progress of the campaign, and the items to be reviewed.An administrator can use this page to manage the execution of a campaign. They can see the progress and any items still outstanding. They can reassign one or more items. They can also prematurely end the campaign.

>**Note:** Please notify a lab assistant if there is no campaign listed.

### Participating in an Access Certification Campaign

For the purposes of this lab, we decided to assign the Okta tenant administrator ( You ) to be the certifier of this particular campaign. However, you will need to access the **Okta Access Certification Reviews** app from your End User Dashboard.

1. In the Okta admin's End User Dashboard, launch the **Okta Access Certification Reviews** app.
2. Click on the **Title Change** to see an overview of the campaign.
3. You will see all applications assigned to this user.

> For each item, you have three options as a reviewer: Approve (leave the access as is), Revoke (remove access or flag for it to be removed), or Reassign (to another Okta user). You will see the icons or icons and words depending on the screen resolution.

5. Click on the name of one of the applications to see information about the user and resource
This information is provided to help the reviewer in making their decision. Currently, it includes user details and resource details, but there are plans to include fine-grained access information (if available) and review history.
6. Click **Approve**.
7. When prompted, enter a **Justification**,  and then click the **Submit**.

### End the Campaign

The campaign can be completed manually once the review is done or automatically after the **Set duration** passes.

1. In the Okta Admin Console select **Identity Governance** > **Access Certifications**.
2. Click the **Title Change** campaign and verify that the **Progress** is **100%**.
3. To end the campaign, click **Actions**, and then select **End**.
4. Click **End Campaign**.

## Conclusion

In this lab, we've charted the exciting terrains of application access with a dash of approval spice! While employees are keen to dive into their toolkits, we've ensured that some access is granted with a nod of approval. And for our administrative maestros? Setting up those approvals was as easy as pie, and periodic access reviews? Piece of cake!
